\title{
Quality control of MaxQuant derived proteomic data.
}
\description{
mqqc provides functions to quality control the performance of LCMS systems by analyzing proteomic data from MaxQuant calculations. A hot folder can be set, that is continuously scanned for new MaxQuant data or raw files (only Windows) in the background.
As input for the quality control serves the evidence.txt from MQ calculations. This function works on all systems.

Windows: Use observe.folder() to set a folder that is continously scanned for new raw files to start MQ runs.
Other Systems: Use start.qc() to select evidence.txt to start quality control.
